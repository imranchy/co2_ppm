# co2_ppm

This is a Data Visualisation and prediction of CO2 ppm levels. The data were collected for three different periods of time for about a month
from a hous in Dhaka city. The data were collected using an IoT based CO2 measuring device built using Arduino and a gas sensor. 
After the data collection process, the data were then saved in a csv file format, then the date were processed for visualisation and prediction. 
The Support Vector Regressor Algorithm was trained on the dataset to make a prediction.
