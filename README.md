# co2_ppm

This is a Data Visualisation and prediction of CO2 ppm levels Project. The data was collected for three different periods of time for about a month
in Dhaka city. The data collection was done using an IoT based CO2 measuring device built using Arduino and a gas sensor. 
After the data collection process, it was then stored as a csv file format and processed for visualisation and prediction. 
The Support Vector Regressor Algorithm was trained on the dataset to make a prediction.
